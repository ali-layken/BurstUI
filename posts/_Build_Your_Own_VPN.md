## How did we end up here?

### *Step 1:* Connecting to the Internet

#### A Fresh Linux Install

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was trying to install :arch_linux:[Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org/) on an old Chromebook and y'all didn't lie, I don't even have a [window manager](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Window_manager), yet and I've had to [pick a font](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Font_configuration), decide on a [network manager](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Network_configuration#Network_managers), and make many more decisions, all of which were tough without an internet connection. Arch is brutally customizable and I look forward to sharing my ArchBookOS setup in a future post...
<br/><br/>
What got me really distracted, and caused this write-up, was setting the DNS Server my :arch_linux:ðŸ“– should use. Now whats a DNS Server? and why would anyone need one? Well, without one, I simply wasn't able to update my OS or even go to `google.com`:

![No updates & No `google.com`](/2/nodns.png)

#### **What The Heck #1:** IP Address

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How could this be? My laptop is connected to my home router from which it received an IP Address `10.0.0.95`. An [IP Address](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address) is just like [a real home Address](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_numbering): using this IP Address the router and other computers can send information just like sending mail :mailbox_with_mail: to a real address. Without an IP a computer wouldn't even be able to ask for data since the computer it asked wouldn't be sure where to send it back to. This means all requests need a *destination* and a *return address*. We can see that my IP was set properly by doing a little test connection from another computer connected to my router:

![Laptop is on [LAN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_area_network) :heavy_check_mark:](/2/lan.png)

The computers on my home network can find each other just fine, but for some reason, we aren't able to connect to `google.com`? This is because my router is actually a computer:computer: that is running server software that keeps track of all the addresses it has dished out as more computers and phones connect. [A section in my first post](http://bean.deno.dev/blog/Build_Your_Own_Website#wait-its-all-computers--file-systems-earthafricamanastronaut-gunwomanastronaut) covers what constitutes a server software and the communication patterns we use on the internet, but for now lets just say that means my router is listening for computers sending data that would count as an IP Address request. I used [`iwd`](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Iwd#iwctl) to look for available Wi-fi networks and connect to my router. `iwd` worked with some lower level OS services, `networkd` and `resolvd`, to first ask my router for an IP address and then make it available for applications like `pacman` & `ping` to use so they can send and receive data. HTTP servers listen and respond to website requests from browsers & other HTTP tools like Chrome, Firefox, and `ping`. Similarly, [DHCP](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/networking/technologies/dhcp/dhcp-top) is a protocol server softwares use to listen for IP Address requests from clients, in this case, initiated by `iwd`, and keep track of their properties like their expiry. Delivering [packets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_packet), to IP addresses that my router has dished out is trivial; it knows very well how to send data to an address it is maintaining, however, to find a [*hostname*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hostname) like `google.com` will require a couple more steps. At this point, if the idea of computer communication is feeling unclear :mag:, please check out the short and sweet section I linked above and [here](http://bean.deno.dev/blog/Build_Your_Own_Website#wait-its-all-computers--file-systems-earthafricamanastronaut-gunwomanastronaut) for an interactive example.

### *Step 2:* Connecting to a DNS Server

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Above, we saw that, given an IP Address, my router was able to properly... *route*, to the correct computer. If only we knew the address of the computer serving `google.com` or the update files; then we could just ask our router to go there. Luckily there are computers running another special server software following the [DNS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System) protocol that we can use to request conversions from *hostnames* into IP Addresses. On my :arch_linux:ðŸ“– i can set the DNS server to be used by editing `/etc/resolv.conf` but across OSs, in Wi-fi Settings Tabs on phones and Control Panels on Desktops there usually exists the ability to manually set a DNS Server:

![*Wi-Fi* > *__i__ next to network name* > *Configure DNS*](/2/dnssettings.png)

Unlike my :arch_linux:ðŸ“– my iPad :apple_logo: runs [the superior linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darwin_(operating_system)) that always just works, because it "Automatically" used the DNS server that the DHCP response told the machine to use. `75.75.75.75` is the address of Xfinity's Public DNS Server because my router's software is controlled by Xfinity so I can't edit the DNS Server they set in the DHCP request. This means every time i request `google.com` my iPad asks Xfinity's computer for `google.com`'s address. The Server will lookup that hostname in a giant table or ask another DNS Server for help using its massive table. Knowing Xfinity, they will probably take some more steps to log that I looked up Super Smash Bros. Combo Videos on Youtube and then sell that information so that Amazon advertise Nintendo Switches to me. In the end you'll get back an IP Address that our computer can use to connect to the computer hosting the service we are trying to access.

At this point most :arch: guides recommend connecting to any random software company's :google_logo: computer. I am not exactly sure why, but I didn't want to do this. My first search for alternatives led me to discover [Pi-hole](https://pi-hole.net/) which gave me both a [reason](https://docs.pi-hole.net/guides/dns/unbound/) and a method. Pi-Hole is server software that can be configured to handle DNS and DHCP requests and in the rest of this post we will be using it to setup a DNS Server. This is perfect since I already have a [Raspberry Pi 4 B](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/):computer: setup to run services in containers.

#### I thought we were making a VPN...

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not going to stop there, recently at my software job, I have had to research some new mobile:iphone: exploits, so I wanted to try securing my Google Pixel 6's network traffic while outside :earth_africa: my local network. To do this I'll also be setting up [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/). Tailscale creates an encrypted [p2p connection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer-to-peer) directly from my phone and whatever network its on (5G, Wi-Fi, Hotspot) to the pi behind my router. This means that when I am outside my house, my phone will be able to connect to my pi through the shortest possible route and not even the owners of the network will be able to see the content of the packets I am sending since they are encrypted. Tailscale provides a static (unchanging) IP for each device you add and they support pretty much every OS where you can install a VPN. Previously, I was using this static IP to easily ssh into my pi from phone while outside, but in this post we will instead be focused on my pi's port 53 and configuring it to accept DNS requests. We will set the pi's static IP as the DNS on my phone but beyond that we will setup a Tailscale [exit-node](https://tailscale.com/kb/1103/exit-nodes) so that not only ssh and DNS, but all internet requests are first encrypted and go to my pi for decryption and then out my home router to the internet. This setup all together is effectively a Private VPN because this is all that normal VPNs like NordVPN do without the tracking or fee. There are a few features that commercial VPNs offerings that I can't setup... alone; using Tailscale you can [privately share access](https://tailscale.com/kb/1084/sharing) to services and entire machines running on your tailnet meaning a group of international friends could setup a very efficient geographical VPN. For example, If I asked a friend in Canada, I could set my phone's exit-node to bro's pi and access TikTok [like nothing happened](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Censorship_of_TikTok).

## Where do we go? (VPN Setup)

### *Step 2:* Containers

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I love [containers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LXC) for their security and diversity and portability. Containers [can get very complex](https://hub.docker.com/r/microsoft/windows) but the basic idea for us today is that they are like mini customizable OS environments that you can easily bring up and down with a script. Separating computing environments helps keep things simple; lets say my laptop is using python 3.12 located at `/usr/bin/python`, I won't have to mess with this binary or path at all if pihole asks for say Python 3.10. Instead, the alternate Python version will just be installed inside the container and found when pihole tries to run `$ python`. Terribly set up containers can have more [overhead](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overhead_(computing)) than a perfectly optimized [Virtual Machines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_machine): which is like running a computer inside your computer. You have done this before if you've ever run a Video Game Emulator like [Dolphin](https://dolphin-emu.org/). If used properly however, people have reported being able to run over 50+ containers simultaneously on a Pi 4. The finesse of a container comes from its special ability to choose which requirements to share from the host machine. To follow the example above, I don't want the host's Python version, but pihole will need an internet connection so I can share my host's network with the container. This wouldn't be possible on the VM because it would have made its own virtual network device which would be treated like a whole separate machine by my router; why should i be running 2 copies of `networkd`? its simply not needed. If you are having a hard time understanding the use of containers, for this post, I give you permission to imagine them as VMs, but tomorrow you're installing [Podman Desktop](https://podman-desktop.io/) and trying it out right?
<br/><br/>

### Pi-Hole
To make things simpler for now I'll be using podman root containers, but I know [it can be hardened](https://b-woody.com/posts/2022-05-12-pihole-on-a-rootless-podman-container/) later. From [the pihole post](https://docs.pi-hole.net/guides/dns/unbound/) that got us here I knew I was going to have to use unbound so i started by combining the compose scripts for [pihole compose](https://hub.docker.com/r/pihole/pihole) and unbound [unbound](https://hub.docker.com/r/klutchell/unbound). Compose scripts are used to describe to podman how you want your containers brought up. Theres a couple of important pieces so lets take a look at the file:

```yml
# More info at https://github.com/pi-hole/docker-pi-hole/
networks:
  hole_net:
    driver: bridge
    enable_ipv6: true  # Enable IPv6 support
    ipam:
      config:
        - subnet: "192.168.2.0/24"  # IPv4 subnet
        - subnet: "fd14:d095:b9ef:80f2::/64" # IPv6 subnet

services:
  unbound:
    container_name: unbound
    image: docker.io/klutchell/unbound:latest
    volumes:
      - type: bind
        read_only: true
        source: ./unb-conf
        target: /etc/unbound/custom.conf.d
    restart: unless-stopped
    networks:
      hole_net:
        ipv4_address: 192.168.2.2

  pihole:
    container_name: pihole
    image: docker.io/pihole/pihole:latest
    #   For DHCP it is recommended to remove these ports 
    # and instead add: network_mode: "host"
    ports:
      # LAN
      - "10.0.0.2:53:53/tcp"
      - "10.0.0.2:53:53/udp"
      # Tailscale
      - "<redacted pi tailscale ipv4>:53:53/tcp"
      - "<redacted pi tailscale ipv4>:53:53/udp"
      - "[<redacted pi tailscale ipv6>]:53:53/tcp"
      - "[<redacted pi tailscale ipv6>]:53:53/udp"
      # Admin
      - "80:80/tcp"
    environment:
      TZ: 'America/Detroit'
      WEBPASSWORD: '<redacted>'
      DNSMASQ_LISTENING: 'all'
      PIHOLE_DNS_: "192.168.2.2#5335"
    # Volumes store your data between container upgrades
    volumes:
      - './etc-pihole:/etc/pihole'
      - './etc-dnsmasq:/etc/dnsmasq.d'
    restart: unless-stopped
    networks:
      hole_net:
        ipv4_address: 192.168.2.3
    depends_on:
      - unbound
```

We don't need to use unbound's [redis integration](https://github.com/ar51an/unbound-redis) for caching DNS requests because this will be taken care of by pihole's [FTLDNS](https://docs.pi-hole.net/ftldns/dns-cache/) "Faster Than Light DNS" includes a caching feature that will take care of that. Running the [the official Pi-Hole compose scripts](https://hub.docker.com/r/pihole/pihole) causes issues due to podman's [aardvarkdns](https://github.com/containers/aardvark-dns) taking up port 53 on the host. Aardvark helps translate container names into their virtual IP addresses. Computers can be associated with multiple IPs and *hostnames* that can be used to find them on different networks. Later each of our computers will receive that IP i mentioned from Tailscale which is it's address on the tailnet. To get around [this aardvark issue](https://github.com/containers/podman/discussions/14242) we will map pihole's port 53 to a specific IP's port 53. Port 53 was already in use for some of my computer's IPs, the ones related to podman, but it was free to bind for my LAN IP `10.0.0.2` and my tailnet IP `<redacted pi tailscale ipv4>`. Now these 2 IPs are listening for DNS requests on port 53.

The compose file above also contains a `WEBPASSWORD` and forward pihole's port 80 to the host. Check if pihole started up fine by visiting `10.0.0.2/admin` in a web browser. You should be greeted with an admin portal where you can login using `WEBPASSWORD`. After logging in there are a couple settings we will need to modify:
<br/><br/>

1. Under *Settings* > *DNS* > *Upstream DNS Servers* we will have to tell pihole where to find unbound. In the compose file we put the pihole container and unbound on the same container network and gave them the IPs `192.168.2.3` and `192.168.2.2` respectively. The syntax for this entry is slightly different because the port is separated with a `#` whereas usually ports are described using `:` so be careful: ![Pi-Hole DNS Settings](/2/piholeset.png)

2. To support DNS requests over the tailnet we will have to disable the hop-based filtering in *Interface Settings* right under the *Upstream DNS Server* section, but don't worry, we will secure our whole network after we get everything up.

3. I found that DNSSEC worked properly when unchecked and improperly when checked probably due to unbound but you are welcome to do your own research. Check the first 2 options under *Advanced DNS Settings* for speed and security unless you have some other sort of setup you are going for.

### Pi-Hole
Next I installed tailscale on my pi [tailscaleddl](https://tailscale.com/download) and used $ tailscale up --accept-dns=false --advertise-exit-node to start tailscale on the pi. This will allow it to be used as the DNS server and it allows it to act as a VPN for my phone.

On my Pixel 6 I set my Private DNS to Automatic or Off (I couldn't find a difference). Setting the 'Private DNS provider hostname'  didn't work either for any hostname I tried as it doesnt take ips. I set the VPN to 'Always-on VPN' and 'Block connections without VPN'. For WiFi I have Static DHCP with the pi's local and tailscale ipv4 since it only takes ipv4s.

To allow connections to my computers and routter gateway i used tailscales subnet routing

After everything is said and done:
