## How did we end up here?

### *Step 1:* Connecting to the Internet
#### A Fresh Linux Install
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was trying to install :arch_linux:[Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org/) on an old Chromebook and y'all didn't lie, I don't even have a [window manager](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Window_manager), yet and I've had to [pick a font](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Font_configuration), decide on a [network manager](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Network_configuration#Network_managers), and make many more decisions, all of which were tough without an internet connection. Arch is brutally customizable and I look forward to sharing my ArchBookOS setup in a future post...
<br/><br/>
What got me really distracted, and caused this write-up, was setting the DNS Server my :arch_linux:ðŸ“– should use. Now whats a DNS Server? and why would anyone need one? Well, without one; I simply wasn't able to update my OS or even go to `google.com`:

#### **What The Heck #1**: IP Address
How could this be?: The laptop is connected to my home router from which it [received an IP Address (10.0.0.95)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/networking/technologies/dhcp/dhcp-top). An [IP Address](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address) is just like [a real home Address](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_numbering): using this IP Address the router and other computers can send information just like sending mail to a real address. We can see this for sure by doing a little test connection:

#### DNS
Seems like the computers on my home network can find each other. This is because my router is keeping track of all the addresses it has dished out as computers and phones connect. However, to find a *hostname* like `google.com` had d Across OSs, in Wi-fi Settings Tabs on phones and Configuration Files Linux there exists the ability to set a DNS Server: 

When that config is in use and a network request is made that includes hostnames like browsing to nerdculture.de or sshing into CromeArch.local; before getting the website content, the OS will <b>first send the hostname to the IP listed as the DNS Server on port 53</code></b>. The Server will lookup that hostname in a giant table or ask another DNS Server for help using its massive table. In the end you'll get back an IP Address that you computer can use to connect. 

At this point :arch: guides recommend connecting to any random software company's :omya_google: computer that has port 53 open. The first alternative I found was using pi-hole which is perfect, I already have a pi setup to run services in containers. Don't take my word for it, you can read pi-hole's own explanation of why its tough to trust public DNS Servers here:

### The Goal 
However, I am not going to stop there, recently at work I have been checking out new mobile exploits, so I wanted to try securing my phone's traffic while outside my local network. So I'll also be integrating Tailscale. Tailscale creates an encrypted p2p connection directly from my phone and whatever network its on outside to the pi behind my router. Tailscale provides a static IP for each device you add and they support pretty much every OS where you can install a VPN. Previously I could use this to access the services on my pi i mentioned above outside.

## Setting Up The VPN

### Pi-hole
Lets start with the DNS Server: pihole. I love containers for their security and diversity and portability. To make things simpler for now I''l be using podman root containers, but I know it can be hardened later [hard](https://b-woody.com/posts/2022-05-12-pihole-on-a-rootless-podman-container/). From the pihole post above I knew I was going to use unbound so i started by combining the compose scripts for pihole [pihole compose](https://hub.docker.com/r/pihole/pihole) and unbound [unbound](https://hub.docker.com/r/klutchell/unbound)

We don't need to use unbound's redis integration for caching because pihole's FTLDNS "Faster Than Light DNS" includes a caching feature [fastre tthan light](https://docs.pi-hole.net/ftldns/dns-cache/) that will take care of that. 

Moving on will immediately cause issues due to podman's aardvarkdns taking up port 53. To get around this we will map pihole's 53 to a specific ip's port 53 [aardcvark issue](https://github.com/containers/podman/discussions/14242) Additionally in the pihole compose I included the ip address of unbound :5335 which is the port unbound should be configured to use if you followed the unbound link above.

Next I installed tailscale on my pi [tailscaleddl](https://tailscale.com/download) and used $ tailscale up --accept-dns=false --advertise-exit-node to start tailscale on the pi. This will allow it to be used as the DNS server and it allows it to act as a VPN for my phone.

On my Pixel 6 I set my Private DNS to Automatic or Off (I couldn't find a difference). Setting the 'Private DNS provider hostname'  didn't work either for any hostname I tried as it doesnt take ips. I set the VPN to 'Always-on VPN' and 'Block connections without VPN'. For WiFi I have Static DHCP with the pi's local and tailscale ipv4 since it only takes ipv4s.

To allow connections to my computers and routter gateway i used tailscales subnet routing


After everything is said and done:
